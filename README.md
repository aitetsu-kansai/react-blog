# React Blog project

This project is a web application built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Redux Toolkit**. It is designed to manage state and handle asynchronous actions in a fast and efficient manner. The project is optimized for development speed and ease of use.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web projects.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A toolset for efficient Redux development.
- **Yarn**: Package manager for handling dependencies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (>=14.0.0)
- **Yarn** (for managing dependencies)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
   cd your-project-name
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies using **Yarn**:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. To start the API, run the following command in the `api` directory:

   ```bash
   cd api
   yarn start
   ```

4. To start the front-end, go back to the root directory and run:

   ```bash
   yarn run dev
   ```

   This will launch the application in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Development

### Scripts

- **yarn run dev**: Starts the development server for the front-end.
- **yarn start** (in `/api`): Starts the API server.

### Build

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `/dist` folder.
